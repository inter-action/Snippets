DONE:
    two logging cant work together: 
        Merged to one module
    make error explict: 
        logging.exception() method does exactly this
    check is job muti-threading? : 
        I think it is. cause all the jobs fill in the lines, that will run at exact time you configured at head.

    make logging tool an independent module
        make logging determinate which module it called 

    check in days should be configurable and skip saturday & sunday
    add a checkout for myself
    test checkout
    add random computation to checkin.
    scheduler module configuration move to configloader module


PENDING:
    move autocheckin host info into configure file
